AWS machine = EC2 instance - coming from some region
Indian Regions - Mumbai, Hyderabad

Mumbai has multiple buildings wide apart 60-70 km initially, now close also, 
problem having in one dosnt effect other eg earthquack 
each have independant infra in that entire region - virus attack protect for example

YTube - watch Data centres

Create Account - by default vpc - virtual private cloud - network only for me. (software networks)
subnet - network in that building
not mandatory to use all building, but in prod maybe use 5 out of 6

2 subnets when want to use 2 building s1, s2
freedom to select s1 or s2. - in same vpc by default s1 nd s2 can talk

Internet Gateway - connect a subnet to it - then only outside aws can talk to it - it becomes a public subnet

private subnet - not connect to igw - put load balancer - then it will redirect to services
this is first level of security

vpc, subnet, machine levels security - layered security

load balancer sit on public subnet 

Summary:
AWS machine (EC2 instance) lives inside a 
Subnet → inside a VPC → inside a Region → in one AZ.
Internet Gateway connects public subnets to the world.
Load balancers sit in public subnets, 
routing traffic to private subnets for better security.
