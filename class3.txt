DevOps & CI/CD Notes

Package Managers

mvn - used for Java (Maven)

npm - used for Node.js

pip - used for Python

Build & Testing

Build compiles the code but does not run unit tests.

Running "mvn package" or "mvn install" compiles the code and runs unit tests.

Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is triggered when a pull request (PR) is merged, when a branch is merged, or when code is pushed to the repository.

Typical CI pipeline steps:
1. Code checkout
2. Linting
3. Secrets scan
4. Build
5. Unit testing
6. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
7. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
8. Dockerization
9. Image scan
10. Sign artifact
11. Push artifact to repository
12. Trigger Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Delivery (CD)

Typical CD pipeline steps:
1. Deploy to staging or test environment
2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
3. Integration tests
4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scan
5. Secrets check
6. Approval for production
7. Production deployment
8. Runtime security checks
9. Monitoring and feedback

Testing Types

SIT stands for System Integration Testing.
Types of unit testing include functional testing, regression testing, mock testing, and boundary testing.
Types of artifacts include JARs, WARs, Docker images, and binaries.

Code Coverage

Definition: Code coverage measures how much of your source code is executed during automated tests (unit, integration, etc.).
Types of code coverage include line coverage, branch coverage, function coverage, and statement coverage.

Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

Continuous Delivery:
A typical flow is SIT, then performance testing, then DAST, then manual approval, and optional production deployment. This may also include NLP testing and alpha/beta testing.

Continuous Deployment:
A typical flow is SIT, then performance testing, then DAST, and then automatic production deployment with no manual approval.

Linux

Kernel: The kernel acts as an adapter between hardware (keyboard, CPU, monitor, printer, hard disk, etc.) and software.
The kernel manages the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

AWS Console Basics - Creating an EC2 Instance

Size determines the instance's CPU, RAM, and type.
Key Pair is used for SSH access.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) defines the network boundary.
Subnet is a smaller network inside a VPC.
IP Addresses:
- Private IP is used for internal AWS communication and is not accessible from the internet.
- Public IP is internet-accessible, assigned automatically, and changes when the instance is stopped or restarted.
- Elastic IP is a static public IP that can be attached or detached from any instance.
